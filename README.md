## Description
The goal of this project is to fix bugs and gameplay inconsistencies across all Halo titles. These fixes are in the form of tags, which can be used in all official Halo modding tool to compile a level or multiplayer map.

While our goal is to not modify the sandbox for the sole purpose of changing the way these games play, if a bug fix or inconsistency fix end up changing how a certain aspect plays we have no intention of trying to work around it in a half-hearted manner.
